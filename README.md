# Valorant-API

## Description
#### The Valorant V is a place where anyone can learn more about Valorant's agents in a interactive way. Other features like a custom loadout, play, shop, and settings, are available as well!

#### The purpose of this page is to have a place where Valorant fans, or people who are new to Valorant, can see all of the agents in one place and learn more about them. With interactivity on the page. Inspired by Valorant's site and game design, also inspired by Overwatch's menus. This page is simple for ease of use for any one of any age. 

## Technologies Used
### This page is using the Valorant API (https://dash.valorant-api.com/) 

## Getting Started

### The main menu has 5 pages to pick from. 

### PLAY contains a direct link to Valorant's website to download the game. 

### AGENTS page has an auto rotating carousel. Let the images shuffle until it lands on the agent you want to know more about, then click them. A new page appears where you can hover over each ability to learn more. The back button at the top left takes you a page back.

### SHOP is a non-functioning store, where you can look at skins available and how much they cost.

### LOADOUT is very simple to use. Click the player card, or any of the 5 boxes to open up their corresponding list. Then select which item you want to fill up that box. This is where you get to go around and customize your personal loadout. To make the list go away after clicking on it, click it again.

### SETTINGS is where you're given the option to change the pages colors. This isn't function yet!! Coming soon.
